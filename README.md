Inexact subspace projection methods for computing approximate eigenvectors in the Tensor Train (TT) format. This repository requires the TT-Toolbox https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox
Running the script compare_subspace.m computes approximate eigenvectors of a Heisenberg Hamiltonian using Lanczos method and Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration and compares convergence of the two methods. This reproduces the result of Figure 7.1 in https://arxiv.org/html/2502.19578v2
